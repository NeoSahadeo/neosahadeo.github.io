title: Transfering Over From Sphinx
tags:
  - update
---
The original posts were written in Sphinx where I rolled my own server and scripts.

My journal now uses 11ty and there isn't a direct transfer from reStructuredText to the CMS I am now using. This means that I will, on occasion, transfer over the content from that repository which is still [available here](https://github.com/NeoSahadeo/journal/tree/sphinx_journal).

All my posts will now be on this page.
